I am currently attempting to build a basic tetris clone using my current knowledge of the C programming language.
My motivation for doing this project is to learn and push myself to get a functioning personal project done. 
The main problem that this project will tackle is making me a stronger and more proficient thinker.
I have had a lot of fun and some difficulties throughout building this project and hope to get it done soon. 
A further goal would be to optimize and implement this project on hardware.
